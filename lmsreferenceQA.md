## Prerequisites and Setup

1. **Main Prerequisites**:
   - Frappe Framework
   - Python, MariaDB, Redis, Node.js
   - Git for version control
   - Nginx for production

2. **Purpose of the `bench init frappe-bench` Command**:
   The `bench init frappe-bench` command creates a new directory structure for your Frappe app, initializing necessary directories like `frappe-bench`, `sites`, and `apps`. It sets up the Frappe environment and creates the basic structure to begin working with apps and sites.

3. **Key Directories in `frappe-bench`**:
   - `sites`: Contains the sites (databases) for the app.
   - `apps`: Contains the app source code.
   - `logs`: Contains logs for errors and operations.
   - `config`: Holds configuration files.

## DocType Creation and Management

4. **DocType in Frappe Framework**:
   A **DocType** is a model that defines a database table and its behavior in the Frappe framework. It is similar to models in other web frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails.

5. **Creating the Article DocType**:
   The fields required for the **Article** DocType are:
   - `Title`: Data
   - `Content`: Text
   - `Category`: Select
   - `Status`: Select
   - `Publish Date`: Date

   **Naming Convention for Articles**:
   The naming convention for the **Article** was set to `Article.#####`, where `#####` is an auto-generated number.

## Database and Data Structure

6. **What Happens in the Database When You Create a New DocType**:
   When you create a new DocType, Frappe automatically generates a corresponding table in the database. Each field in the DocType corresponds to a column in the table.

7. **Standard Fields in DocTypes**:
   - `name`: Primary key of the document.
   - `owner`: The creator of the document.
   - `created`: Timestamp when the document was created.
   - `modified`: Timestamp when the document was last modified.
   - `docstatus`: Indicates whether the document is in draft, submitted, etc.

8. **Link Field Type**:
   The **Link** field type creates a relationship between two DocTypes, similar to a foreign key in other frameworks. In the Library Management System, **Library Member** is linked to **Library Membership** via the **Link** field.

## Permissions and Security

9. **Roles Created for the Library Management System**:
   - **Librarian**: Has full CRUD operations on all documents.
   - **Library Member**: Can only view their own membership and transaction details.

10. **Permissions for Librarian and Library Member**:
    - The **Librarian** role can create, edit, and delete any document, while the **Library Member** role can only view their own data.
    - Actions like editing and deleting documents can be restricted using permission rules.

---

## Controller Methods

11. **Purpose of Controller Methods in DocTypes**:
    Controller methods define business logic that runs at different points in a document's lifecycle (e.g., before saving, before submitting).

12. **Usage of `before_save` in Library Member**:
    The `before_save` method was used to ensure that no two memberships for the same member can overlap.

13. **Validation in Library Transaction Controller**:
    Validation ensures the correct status of an article before it's issued and ensures that memberships are active before issuing an article.

---

## Types of DocTypes

14. **Submittable DocType**:
    A **Submittable** DocType is a type of document that can be submitted (finalized). In the Library Management System, **Library Membership** is a submittable DocType.

15. **Single DocType**:
    A **Single DocType** holds only one record. **Library Settings** is a Single DocType because we only need one set of settings for the whole library system.

---

## Form Scripts and UI

16. **Custom Buttons on Library Member Form**:
    Custom buttons were added to trigger actions like issuing or returning books. These buttons enhance the form's functionality.

17. **Enhancement with Form Scripts**:
    Form scripts allow you to add custom behavior to forms, such as showing alerts or performing validations when users interact with the form.

---

## Portal Pages

18. **Enabling Web View for Articles**:
    To enable web view for articles, we enabled **Has Web View** and **Allow Guest to View** in the DocType settings. The route field is used to specify the URL path.

19. **Difference Between `article.html` and `article_row.html`**:
    - `article.html` is used for the full display of an article.
    - `article_row.html` is used for displaying a summary or list of articles.

---

## System Integration

20. **Handling Article Status Changes**:
    Article status changes (e.g., issued, returned) are tracked by updating the **Status** field in the Article DocType. When issuing an article, the system ensures the article's availability.

21. **Membership Validation**:
    The system checks if a member has an active membership before allowing them to issue an article. This is validated in the controller method using the `before_submit` hook.

---

## Technical Implementation

22. **Handling Database Queries**:
    Database queries are handled using Frappe's ORM, like `frappe.db.get_all()` for fetching records or `frappe.db.insert()` for adding new records.

23. **Throwing Validation Errors**:
    Validation errors are thrown using `frappe.throw()` to display messages like "This field cannot be empty" or custom validation messages.

24. **Naming System for Articles**:
    Articles are named using the naming convention `Article.#####`, where `#####` is an auto-generated number to uniquely identify each article.

25. **Article Availability Tracking**:
    Availability is tracked by the **Status** field in the Article DocType. It changes based on whether the article is issued or available.

## App Installation and Management

26. **What Happens if You Try to Install an App Without Specifying the `--site` Flag?**
    An error will occur because Frappe cannot determine which site the app should be installed on.

27. **What Files or Configurations Are Updated When an App Is Installed?**
    - The app's configuration is added to the siteâ€™s `site_config.json`.
    - The app's database tables and modules are initialized.

28. **Can the Same App Be Installed on Multiple Sites?**
    Yes, the same app can be installed on different sites within the same `frappe-bench`.

29. **What Happens if the App Installation Fails?**
    You can troubleshoot the failure by checking the error logs or using the following command:
    ```
    bench --site <site_name> reinstall
    ```
    You can also inspect the logs in `logs/bench.log` for further details.

30. **What is the Role of `hooks.py` During App Installation?**
    `hooks.py` defines custom initialization steps, like adding fixtures or setting up permissions, which are executed during the app installation process.

31. **How Do You Handle App Dependencies?**
    - Specify dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file of the app, which will be automatically installed when the app is installed.
    - Check error logs for details using:
    ```
    bench --site <site_name> reinstall
    ```
    Or inspect the logs in `logs/bench.log`.
